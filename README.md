## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Some features I am planning to add are:
- add instructional text in option columns to suggest to users what to link for classes, homework, and pins
- make the size of the popup smaller and make the scrollbar prettier
- add the ability to reorder lists
